This is a macaque angiography dataset obtained from the Brainnetome Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences Institute of Automation.
This dataset set is composed of 8 TOF-MRA scans, of which 4 are scanned with 3 Tesla Siemens machine and other 4 are scanned with 7 Tesla Siemens machine.

Please cite the following reference if you use this dataset:

Cui Yue, et al. "FFCM-MRF: An accurate and generalizable cerebrovascular segmentation pipeline on TOF-MRA".

every original folder (i.e. non-derivative) contains the TOF-MRA and the T1w volume of the subjects. Instead, the "derivatives" folder contains 2 sub-folders:

1) "manual_masks": It contains the skull-stripped TOF-MRA volume for each subject.
2) "N4_bias_field_corrected": for every subject, it contains the corresponding N4-bias-field-corrected skull-stripped TOF-MRA volume using ANTS.
3) "vesselness": for every subject, it contains the corresponding vessel enhancement image for skull-stripped TOF-MRA volume.
4) "labels": for every subject, it contains the corresponding intracranial cerebrovascular labels within skull-stripped TOF-MRA volume.
